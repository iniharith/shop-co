## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 🔐 SSH Login (for EC2 Hosting)

```bash
ssh -i "shop-co3.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-109-142-4.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

### 📥 Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abshar777/shop-co.git
cd shop-co
```

### 🐳 Docker Compose Setup
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command builds and starts the following services:

- **Frontend**: Next.js application
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express API
- **Redis**: For caching and WebSocket message brokering
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user, product, and order data

### 🌍 Environment Variables

Ensure the following `.env` files are created for proper configuration.

#### Backend (`/backend/.env`)

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/shopco
JWT_SECRET=_jwt_secret
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
```
#### Frontend (/frontend/.env)

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://api.studioivory.art

NEXTAUTH_SECRET= _next_auth_SCRETE

NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL=https://studioivory.art
```


#### Admin (/admin/.env)

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://api.studioivory.art

NEXTAUTH_SECRET= _next_auth_SCRETE

NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL=https://studioivory.art
```

## 🌐 Hosting & Deployment Steps (on EC2)

1. SSH into your EC2 instance:
   - `ssh -i path-to-your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-ip`

2. Install Docker & Docker Compose (if not already installed):
   - `sudo apt update`
   - `sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y`

3. Clone the repository:
   - `git clone https://github.com/Abshar777/shop-co.git`
   - `cd shop-co`

4. Add your `.env` files in `frontend/` and `backend/`.

5. Start the services:
   - `docker-compose up -d`

6. Set up **NGINX** reverse proxy and **SSL** using **Certbot** for secure HTTPS connections.

7. Ensure that the EC2 security group allows access to the following ports:
   - **Port `80`** (HTTP)
   - **Port `443`** (HTTPS)
   - **Port `8000`** (Backend API )
   - **Port `3000`** (Frontend)
   -  **Port `3001`** (Admin)

## 📡 WebSocket Flow Explanation

- When a user places or updates an order, the backend emits a WebSocket event using `Socket.IO`.
- The backend publishes the event message to **Redis** using **Pub/Sub**.
- Redis broadcasts the message to all subscribed backend instances.
- **Clients** (users, admins) and **delivery agents** receive the updates in real-time.

The WebSocket flow ensures that all relevant parties get the updates instantly:
- The **user** sees the real-time order status.
- The **admin** sees the real-time status of all orders.
- The **delivery agent** is notified of any new deliveries or updates in their queue.

---

## 📈 Scaling Plan

### 🔁 Redis for WebSocket Scaling

- The current setup uses **Redis Pub/Sub** to manage real-time communication.
- Redis Pub/Sub ensures that any message sent through WebSockets is broadcast across all backend instances.
- This allows the system to scale horizontally by adding more backend instances without losing real-time data synchronization.

### 🧱 Horizontal Scaling via Load Balancer

- Deploy multiple backend containers using **Docker Swarm** or **Kubernetes**.
- Use **NGINX** or **AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer)** to distribute traffic across multiple backend containers.
- For session management, consider storing session tokens and user data in **Redis** for shared access.

## ✨ Recent Features & Progress (Admin UI & Artworks Manager)

- **Dynamic UI Backgrounds**: Added the ability to set custom UI background images. The backgrounds are stored and manageable via the Profile page and apply a custom backdrop to the Artworks Manager.
- **Granular Folder Sharing**: Upgraded the Share Link feature in the Artworks Manager. It now supports sharing specific sub-folders by generating short links uniquely scoped to a `folderId`, alongside the original group-sharing capability.
- **UI Enhancements**: 
  - Centered folder icons and labels in the grid layout for better aesthetics when stretched.
  - Redesigned the artwork cards by removing the 'Mark as Reviewed' button from folder views.
  - Positioned a floating 'Share' button cleanly at the top-right of the artwork thumbnails in grid view.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- **Payment gateway integration**: Add payment options like Stripe or Razorpay for processing payments.
- **Order analytics dashboard**: Provide an admin panel to analyze order trends, delivery times, and more.
- **OTP authentication (OTP)**: Implement multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
